Where are we running apps to do testing?

Testing is primarily conducted on GCP, using tools like dbt and VS Code.
Are your machines running slowly?

A MacBook Air should typically be suitable for tasks that are mostly cloud-based. However, it is important to know the configuration of the MacBook Air, as performance depends on the processor and RAM.
